# Circuitrocks SensoWing

Want to make a quick prototype with some sensors and your Feather boards? Then you might stumble over the same problem we did. 
The Feather system is great as long as you only need to put some Feathers and some Wings together. But how do you connect your sensors, actuators or display?
Well, you can buy a FeatherWing proto board, solder connectors and wires to it and plug your sensors, actuators or display in. But wait, what if your sensor is one of the Sparkfun sensors with a QUICC connector? Good luck with soldering the 1mm pitch QUICC connector to a prototype board.

Don't worry anymore, all these struggles made us think that a Feather with connectors is a good idea.
Our SensoWing has 5 connectors, already wired to the standard I2C, SPI, Serial and Analog ports of the Feathers.
SensoWing carries
- one QUICC connector with I2C
- one Grove connector with I2C
- one Grove connector with Serial
- one Grove connector with 2 Analog inputs or outputs
- one header for SPI bus with the option to connect the SPI CS to any of the free GPIOs.

Sounds good?
What are you waiting for, order some of them, you will find them handy.
If you have some other sensors or stuff without Grove or QUICC connector, don't worry, we have as well some Grove cables in stock that you can solder to your sensors and just plug them into the SensoWing.

The SensoWing comes without headers soldered to it, so you can solder your own choice of headers to it.

## Applications:
Quick prototyping.
